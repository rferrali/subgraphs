\title{Enumerate all connected subgraphs of a graph}
\usage{
subgraphs(g)
}
\arguments{
\item{g}{a (possibly sparse) adjacency matrix of an undirected, unweighted graph.}
}
\value{
a list where each element is a vector of the ids of the vertices forming a connected subgraph.
}
\description{
Enumerate all connected subgraphs of a graph
}
\details{
the matrix \code{g} should be the adjacency matrix of an undirected, unweighted graph.
Its values should be either 0 or 1. It should be symmetric and have only zeroes on the diagonal. It can be a sparse matrix as
created by the package \code{Matrix}. This function uses the Depth-First-Search Enumeration algorithm of Skibski et al. (2018).

\examples{
g <- matrix(c(
0,1,0,
1,0,1,
0,1,0
), nrow = 3, ncol = 3)
subgraphs(g)
